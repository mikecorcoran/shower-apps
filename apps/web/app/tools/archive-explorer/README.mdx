title: Archive Explorer
summary: Inspect compressed archives client-side, browse folder trees, and export exactly the files you need.
---

## Purpose

Archive Explorer lets you import an archive directly in the browser, inspect its folder structure, preview contained images, and export selected files without uploading anything to a server.

## Supported formats

- `.zip`
- `.tar`
- `.gz` (single files)
- `.tar.gz` / `.tgz`
- `.7z`

## Workflow

1. Drop an archive or pick one using the file picker.
2. Switch between the **Hierarchy** flyout to manage folders and the **Gallery** to preview images.
3. Select files to download individually or use the **Download selection** action to bundle chosen files into a zip.

## Edge cases

- Zero-byte directories are preserved so the hierarchy stays intact.
- Nested archives are treated as regular files—you can extract them again if needed.
- Large archives extract entirely client-side; keep an eye on memory usage in low-powered devices.

## Notes

All parsing uses WebAssembly or pure JavaScript inside the browser. No file contents ever leave the page.
